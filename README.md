## 1.1. Specification

### 1.1.1. General Specification

The Flanger-effect is caused by a comb filter with the difference equation:

$$y[k] = x[k] + \alpha  \cdot x[k - N].$$

The frequency response of the comb filter has a cosine shape with zeros at distance fa/N. The parameter $\alpha$ determines the strength of the filter, the filter effect, and thus the strength of the flanger effect.

The flanger effect is caused by the fact that the length $N$ of the filter within the period $T$ of the flanger effect is changed linearly from a minimum to a maximum value and back again.

The length $N$ of the comb filter should accept values for which the zeros of the comb filter are located in intervals of between $50\text{Hz}$ and $1\text{kHz}$. The parameter Î± takes values between $-1$ and $1$. The period $T$ of the effect should be between $1\text{s}$ and $10\text{s}$ adjustable.

## 1.2. Principle and Matlab Simulation

### 1.2.1. Basic principles and MATLAB simulation

For the system of flanger-effect, the system function is $$H=\frac{Y}{X}=1+\alpha Z^{-N}.$$

In MATLAB, represent the coefficient of the numerator by creating an array with only one element, and represent that of the denominator by creating an array with two elements. *(Here, choose the gain $\alpha$ to be $0.7$ and the delay factor $N$ to be $1$)*

The MATLAB command **filt** can be used to generate a discrete-time transfer function.

The MATLAB command **zplane** provides the z-plane plot for discrete-time systems.

The MATLAB command **freqz** returns the system responses of both magnitude and phase.

The MATLAB command **impz** gives out the impulse response of the transfer function.

## Design Idea

### The sequence of Signal Flow

From the system diagram in section 1.2.2, the sequence of signal flow is designed to be:

    1. Read in the input signal and store the value into *x*
    2. Do delay operation and get the value of *delayed_input*
    3. Multiply the value of *delayedOutput* by $\alpha$ to get the value of *gainedDelayed_input*
    4. Calculate the value of *y* by adding *gainedDelayed_input* and *x* together
    5. Output the value of *output_y*
